# Hi there 👋

## My name is Carlos Gomes. I'm a Web/mobile developer and QA Tester Analyst living in Caba, Buenos Aires. Currently, I'm looking for new opportunities in the IT industry where I can develop my skills and make a career as such.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on mastering ReactJs and all its frameworks(Gatsby, Next). You will see some projects(most of them clones of famous tech brandings) made with React and Firebase, where this last tech may be used as a database, authentication system and hosting.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native(Mobile development) and starting to get interested in web 3.0

- 📫 How to reach me: If you are looking for candidates or maybe collaboration on any project, you can find me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosgomesvallejo

- ⚡ Fun fact about programming: "The word computer “bug” was inspired by a real bug. A moth, to be precise. Yes, the first computer bug was discovered in 1947, and was a literal bug; or moth stuck inside Grace Hopper’s Harvard Mark II computer."
